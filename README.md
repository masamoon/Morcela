Morcela is a privacy focused paste service written in node.js. Your pastes are encrypted client-side leveraging the WebCrypto API with a password chosen by you. We don't save neither your plaintext information nor any passwords so that, even if there's a breach,your information is safe and also reassures that only you, and the people you shared the password with, can read your pastes. None of the information you save on a paste can be read by us.

The live version is available at [morce.la](http://morce.la/)
